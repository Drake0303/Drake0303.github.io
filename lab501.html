      <p> I think the quote by Suzanne Winckler captures the essence of the prairie best, "...the joy of prairie lies in its subtlety. It is so easy-- too easy-- to be swept away by mountain and ocean vistas. A prairie, on the other hand, requests the favor of your closer attention. It does not divulge itself to mere passersby." (2004, Prairie: A North American Guide)</p>

    <h2>An Interconnected and Intrinsic Ecosystem</h2>
      
       <p> I grew up walking the ponds and woods of Michigan. But I've found that I am also fascinated by the short and mixed-grass prairies of the United States. The landscape hosts such a variety of species, all interconnected in different ways. For example, the black-tailed prairie dog a prey species for animals such as the black-footed ferret, badger, coyote, and foxes to name a few. They also provide critical habitat through their burrowing systems for burrowing owls, black-footed ferrets, salamanders and rattlesnakes. Birds and other small mammals also seek cover from the open landscape in the entrances of prairie dog burrows seeking cover from the hot, intense sun or shelter from predation.</p>
